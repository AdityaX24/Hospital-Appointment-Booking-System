SE Project Hospital Appointment Booking System

The Hospital Appointment Booking System project is a comprehensive endeavor led by a team of four individuals. This initiative seeks to revolutionize healthcare appointment scheduling by digitizing the process to enhance accessibility, efficiency, and patient satisfaction. The project's primary objectives are to automate appointment booking, make healthcare services more readily available through digital channels, and prioritize user-friendliness for a hassle-free experience.

The functional features of the system include the ability for patients to view available doctors and their time slots, book appointments based on doctor availability, engage in online consultations with healthcare providers, and facilitate online prescription and medicine orders. Non-functional aspects encompass creating an attractive and user-friendly front-end, ensuring accessibility for elderly users, securely storing user data for personalized recommendations, and implementing a user login and sign-up system.

The project is meticulously planned over a 12-week timeline, covering project setup, UI/UX design, app development, backend integration, testing, documentation, deployment, finalization, and post-launch monitoring. User acceptance testing and stakeholder involvement play integral roles in the project's success. In sum, the Hospital Appointment Booking System project is poised to transform healthcare scheduling and accessibility for a more patient-centric experience.
